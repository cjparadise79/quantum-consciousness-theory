I'm excited to share my latest research: Quantum Consciousness Theory Refined (QCT-R) Version 3.0 - a unified theory bridging artificial and biological consciousness.

Key contributions:
✓ Hierarchical multi-band oscillatory architecture
✓ Complete resource model for cognitive dynamics
✓ Universal framework for both biological and artificial systems
✓ Testable predictions for empirical validation

This work integrates neuroscience, quantum mechanics, and AI research to provide a comprehensive understanding of consciousness emergence.
